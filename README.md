# Engineering_Project

The project is based on calculating the soil moisture contents and detecting the real time weather condition like temperature, humidity etc. and send it to the farmer using zig-bee communication which will be displayed in the LCD screen and according to temperature conditions the motor present at farm gets operated and hence the moisture present in the soil can be maintained automatically.
